# Mapping
Code, tools and resources to support interactive maps on the mutualaid.nyc website

# Data standards
- For definitions of neighborhood boundaries:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTA-/cpf4-rkhq

- For definitions of Mutual Aid NYC pods boundaries, group descriptions, projects:
A Reference airtable is currently being built. It is similar to the data in this table:

# Longer-term vision
- Mutual Aid US version in mapbox and perhaps to use as a template? 
https://www.mutualaidhub.org/

- Feature rich example of what we could get to eventually:
